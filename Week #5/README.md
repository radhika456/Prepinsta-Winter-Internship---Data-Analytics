## Business Task
Step into the shoes of a detective and solve a murder mystery using SQL. Additionally, embark on a web scraping adventure to collect your dataset, setting the stage for subsequent tasks in data analysis.

## SQL Murder Mystery 
There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a â€‹murderâ€‹ that occurred sometime on â€‹Jan.15, 2018,â€‹ and that it took place in â€‹SQL Cityâ€‹. 

Analyze the results of your SQL queries to piece together the sequence of events and identify potential suspects.
Conclude the detective challenge by summarising your findings and presenting a compelling case.
